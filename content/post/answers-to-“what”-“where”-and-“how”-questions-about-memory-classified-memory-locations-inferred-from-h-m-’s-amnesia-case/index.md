Abstract

As one of the most well-investigated cases in neuroscience history, patient H.M. has offered valuable insight into the essential questions about memory, including what composes memory, where can these subdivisions of memory be found, and how these brain regions work together as a network to support normal functioning of information memorization. Amnesia patients were not the only model used in memory studies, as animals, other degenerating diseases, and modern neuro-imaging techniques all provided valuable information. This article systematically reviewed how the case of H.M. has answered the “what”, “where”, and “how” questions concerning the human memory system, and how approaches evolved in the meanwhile.

Studies about brain lesion patients have provided fruitful insights about cognitive functions (Winslow, 2022), including the components and organization of memory (Scoville & Milner, 1957), which largely contributed to the modular view of the brain-behaviour relationship(Fodor, 1983). In the famous case of H.W., who suffered from serious seizures and had to have an operation, his medial temporal polar cortex was bilaterally removed in a symmetrical way, including the amygdala, and approximately two-thirds of the hippocampal area (Corkin et al., 1997).

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->**1.**     <!--\[endif]-->**Basic findings of H.M.’s case**

H.M. showed symptoms of antegrade amnesia after the removal treatment, suggesting that he could not remember newly-introduced people, or lately-experienced events, unless receiving extensive repetitions constantly (Bear et al., 2020). However, apart from degeneration in memory consolidation, H.M. has also retained most cognitive abilities. 

First off, his distant memory remote from the operation remained intact (i.e., recognizing his mother’s face from a childhood photo); Secondly, the working memory and immediate memory (Sidman et al., 1968) were not harmed by the removal (i.e., being able to memorize numbers if not disrupted); Thirdly, he succeeded in learning a new motor skill (i.e., painting by looking at the mirror); Fourthly, a follow-up study revealed that his intelligence and lexical knowledge remained normal (Kensinger et al., 2001; Milner et al., 1968).

In summary, though showing predominant deficits in forming new declarative memory, H.M. still performed well in other classifications of memory, learning skills, and general cognitive functioning. One key deduction based on these facts is: that memory can be classified into components and be localized in different brain regions, independent of learning and intelligence-relevant processes. 

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->**2.**     <!--\[endif]-->**Components and localization of memory inspired by H.M.**

The predominant contribution of H.M.’s case to the understanding of memory is its leading to a shift from the equipotential to the modular view. As a high-order function, memory had been assumed to be globally carried out by the whole brain(Lashley, 1950), due to a lack of anatomical evidence and non-ideal choice of behavioural tasks. H.M.’s case refuted this idea by isolating memory defects from other functions, and strongly supported the modular theory. A body of experimental studies has then focused on the organization of memory components and their brain regions. 

**2.1 Definition, subdivisions and localization of memory**

***2.1.1 Memory is an independent function***

Impairment of memory occurred in the case of H.M. as a circumscribed disorder, independent from other functions, including intelligence, personality, and lexical as well as grammatical knowledge (Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1988). The previous view insisted that memory could not to isolated to any independent brain regions and relied on the association of the cortex responsible for different information modalities. In a sharp contrast, H.M.’s reservation of intellectual functions and deficits in memorizing all modalities of information has proved memory should be considered an independent psychological function (Eichenbaum, 2013). 

Inspired by these discoveries, later literature has reviewed more systematically the intact abilities in amnesia patients. Conclusively, amnesic patients performed normally in discriminating faces, suggesting well-functioning perception, and information processing, which can be carried out in the absence of making comparisons with previous information. However, if the task involves complex context material (i.e., a virtual-reality scene) and requires detection of repetitive patterns (i.e., detecting the odd object in the array), the patients would show significant impairment (Graham et al., 2006; Suzuki, 2009). 

***2.1.2 Declarative and procedural memory***

The observation of H.M.’s retainment of the ability to learn motor tasks without memory of the relevant acquiring process suggests that memory is a collection of at least two separate entities (Cohen & Squire, 1980). One component is a conscious recollection of the declarative experience, and the other consists of non-conscious learning capacities, namely the non-declarative motor memory system (Squire & Zola, 1996). In addition, non-declarative memory also underlies the mechanism of another unconscious cognitive process, including priming and habituation, which were not found impaired in the example of H.M. (Corkin, 1984, 2002). A similar dissociation was also found in schizophrenia patients, who performed slower in retrieving declarative memory while maintaining intact in the procedural (Perry et al., 2000).

Studies of H.M. and other amnesia patients have discovered a distinction in the nervous mechanism underlying these two forms of memory (Squire, 1984). The loss of the hippocampal region has led to severe and selective impairment in the conscious recalling of facts and events, revealing its role in declarative memory (Cohen & Squire, 1980). In the field of episodic memory, a specific subdivision of the declarative concerning self-experience, evidence from degenerative disease (i.e., Alzheimer’s disease), and imaging studies (i.e., fMRI) also accumulated to support the assumption that the hippocampus is indispensable (Deweer et al., 2001). As for procedural memory, the basal ganglia was presumed to be essential (Lee, 2004). Studies using rTMS to intervene in the motor memory modification of normal functioning subjects have also revealed the involvement of a network, supplementary motor area, and its connection with M1, was important for procedural learning (Censor et al., 2014). 

***2.1.3 Longitude, short-term, and working memory***

Apart from being divided into components based on the content, memory can also be classified using the time scale, resulting in a taxonomy of longitude, short-term and working memory. H.M. was capable of memorizing numbers via constant rehearsal for a short time until he was distracted by a new topic, thus having a normal digit span (Corkin, 1984). He could also make conversation if not required to retrieve the content mentioned earlier. These remarkable observations suggested that H.M. possess an intact short-term and working memory. 

It is too rash, however, to arrive at any conclusion about the role of the hippocampus in short-term and working memory simply with discoveries in amnesia patients. As neuroimaging studies on healthy participants have found robust activation in the hippocampal region when required to retain novel information with working memory (Ben-Yakov & Dudai, 2011; Schon et al., 2004). A more precise statement is, that other regions can support the functioning of short-term and working memory in the absence of the hippocampus. 

The three layers of memory mentioned above are interconnected. Rehearsal serves as a bridge in transforming information stored in the short-term memory into the longitude memory (Craik & Watkins, 1973). The dissociation between the functioning of short-term and longitude memory in H.M. might hint that the medial temporal cortex plays the role in processing newly-acquired information into stored knowledge. Additional evidence includes, functional neuroimaging studies that have found that the activation of the hippocampus during the learning process can predict subsequent memory performance (Wagner et al., 1998). 

***2.1.4 Memory retrieval and consolidation***

Similar to the transformation of content from the short-term to the longitude memory, H.M.’s case also revealed a dissociation between memory retrieval and formation. H.M. was able to recognize famous faces distant from the brain surgery but failed in constructing new memories. It can be deduced that the medial temporal cortex might not be obligatory for the final storage of longitude memory (Scoville & Milner, 1957), yet might serve as a key region in the consolidation of new memory. 

**2.2 Network view of memory**

Damage to the hippocampus has been identified as a key reason for inducing amnesia. This conclusion was confirmed by other case studies which involve damage limited to the hippocampal region (Bartsch et al., 2010; Zola-Morgan et al., 1986).

However, a more comprehensive network system underlying memory is required to fully understand how different memory-related regions cooperate. In the dynamic network theory of memory architecture, modules concerning a specific subdivision of memory can either act independently or serve as a component in the system (Ferbinteanu, 2019). The discussion focused on how information transforms among sensory input, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal striatum, and cortex (Arruda-Carvalho & Clem, 2015; Bassett & Sporns, 2017).

**2.3 Other functions relying on medial temporal cortex**

Extensive observations of H.M. have allowed for a better insight into not only what abilities are retained in amnesia patient, but also what cognitive functions are dependent on memory consolidation, or online information processing that requires a reference. For example, empirical evidence has found that time reproduction for H.M. is similar to the normal if within 20 seconds, and any longer time will be experienced as a square root of the true interval (Richards, 1973). Another piece of evidence, systematically comparing the language comprehension ability between H.M. and a matched-control group, found that H.M. was actually affected by his ability to recognize ambiguity in the sentence (MacKay et al., 1998). Contradictory to the emphasis on intact language ability in H.M., this finding suggests that the removed brain regions also contributed to the formation of new semantic relevant binding nodes. 

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->**3.**     <!--\[endif]-->**Contemporary theories about H.M.**

There are complex observations concerning the structure of memory in the case of H.M., and a unitary theory is necessary. For example, one contemporary view has focused on amnesia patients’ predominant failures in detecting and representing relational relationships among memory elements. They introduced the concept of relational representation and flexibility to explain H.M.’s defect in perceiving a complex scene and imagining future scenarios (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1995; Eichenbaum, 2013).

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->**4.**     <!--\[endif]-->**Review of memory study approaches inspired by H.M.’s case**

**4.1 Interacts between animal models and humans**

Experiments using animals have interacted actively with human studies. Classical models include sea hares, rats, and monkeys. Animal models contributed much to our understanding of structures and neural mechanisms underlying human memory, and simultaneously, animal studies were also inspired by human-based experiments. The case of H.M. inspired researchers to replicate the same lesions in animals (Correll & Scoville, 1965).

Also, after H.M.’s case revealed the division between declarative and procedural memory, a general shift in animal models was a favour of using tasks that specifically captures the impairment in the amnesia human patients, over the traditional skill-based tasks (Gaffan, 1974). For instance, the famous delayed match-to-sample task was adopted in Monkeys (Weinstein, 1941).

**4.2 Patients and neuroimaging**

Brain-lesion amnesia patients may not be ideal for the localization study of the memory system, as they lose multiple brain regions in the surgery, thus prohibiting the direct connection between functional deficits and a specific area. Neuroimaging in normal participants has provided convergent evidence to improve the validity of findings based on patients. 

**4.3 Case study to statistical approaches**

One drawback of a case study such as H.M. is its requirement for extra reliability checks. Contemporary studies tend to use a larger sample in order to perform statistical analysis. Common analysis of t-test, ANOVA, and linear regression model provides a more reliable and stable conclusion compared to a single-case study, and better supports the causal link that the experiment targets at. 

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->**5.**     <!--\[endif]-->**Conclusion**

The case of H.M. has provided significant insight into the components, localization, and working mechanism of memory functioning. Apart from memory-related research, the tragedy of cognitive defects after brain surgery has underlined the importance of updating treatments. In epilepsy (Mauguiere & Corkin, 2015).
