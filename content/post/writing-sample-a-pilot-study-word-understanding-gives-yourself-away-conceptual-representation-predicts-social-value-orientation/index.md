**Abstract**

Humans show different preference for cooperation and competition as they perceive and think of things in distinctive ways. Although previous studies have revealed such difference can be explained by general factors including culture and ideology, more specific mechanism underlying the potential individual differences in decision-making are unknown. Principles of linguistics suggest that language-derived conceptual structure, or word-understanding pattern, as one form of knowledge in the dual coding framework, may correspond with individual’s social value orientation. Here, we empirically examined the hypothesized relationship via collecting 19 participants’ rating-based semantic relationship patterns and their social value orientation (SVO) data from self-report surveys. The study yields statistically significant finding that conceptual representation can reliably predict SVO scores. Uncovering the specific origins of individual difference in social preferences has implications for potential mechanisms to modulate such variance and provides inspirations for developing new social psychometrics.

**Introduction**

Cooperation and competition are two major relationships in human society, but the preference we have for them vary by individuals. For example, when working on a group project together with classmates, some individuals prefer to assign the task delicately and fairly to achieve the best cooperative outcome, while others might focus more on how to highlight themselves and compete with others. Such variation may be explained by the distinctive ways in which we perceive and think of things. Prior attempts have examined the relationship between social preferences and family education and cultural variables. However, cultures and ideologies are relatively general factors with which we understand and predict individual traits in social behaviour. These relevant literatures motivate research into correlation between social preferences and more specific factors lying at the root of culture and ideology, including language-derived knowledge. 

Even though human beings communicate with each other based on a common understanding of language, there is no denying that people can still understand the same language differently(Wang & Bi, 2021). For example, when talking about the word “violence”, speakers with different experience will have distinct understandings. It has always been assumed that such variance in word repertories reflect individual difference in thoughts (Roberson et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2019; Whorf, 1950; Xia et al., 2019). Research has focused on uncovering the relationship between language and domains of non-linguistic processing. It has been empirically shown that vocabulary richness has a positive impact on individual color perception, space perception and other perceptual abilities (Banovic et al., 2018; Danziger, 2011). Other explorations have uncovered correlation between word repertories and complex social-related variables, including political position (Li et al., 2017) and emotional perception (Brooks & Freeman, 2018). In light of prior research, what needs to be explored more is whether these correlations only exist in the specific domains or is general mechanism underlying social behaviours. 

Despite the above findings that have associated word repertories and cooccurrence frequency with perceptual, political, and demographic variables, prior attempts mainly focused on the words that subjects actively use in daily life (Malt, 2020; Vine et al., 2020). Few research to our knowledge have examined whether variations in understandings of words correlates with individual’s social behaviour intendency. As a direct measurement of semantic-formed knowledge structure, word understanding provides a clearer depiction of conceptual representation, which is of high importance in understanding the relationship between knowledge and social behaviour. Herein, we hope to see if different individual’s nuanced interpretations of the same set of vocabulary would predict a consistent inter-subject difference in social preferences. 

**Method**

***Subjects***

Nineteen young, healthy college students (16 female; age: M = 19.58 years, range = 18–20 years) were recruited randomly from Beijing Normal University for the study. Given the novelty of our research question, effect size was not available a priori for power analysis. However, this sample size can provide sufficient evidence about the existence of correlation as a pilot study. All subjects were native Mandarin speakers and were right-handed, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Beijing Normal University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants at the start of the experiment, and all received monetary compensation for their participation.

***Stimuli***

**A word set.** 30 Chinese words composed the stimuli, of which were all highly social-related \[>4] terms (e.g., trust) on 7-point scales by independent raters in prior study (Binder et al., 2016). We examined all the words on common psycholinguistic variables, including word frequency, characteristic, and length via a Mandarin corpus (Sun et al., 2018). To ensure participants’ familiarity with the stimuli, only nouns with a frequency higher than 5 times per million words were selected. 

**Semantic pairwise similarity rating task.** In this paradigm, participants were required to complete the pairwise similarity rating task on a 7-point Likert scale. A total of 435 pairs of stimuli were presented and students had to rate how similar they are in semantic. The instructions read:

*To what degree do you think the word pair below are similar in semantic dimension? Please rate on a 7-point scale, where 1 refers to “not related at all” and 7 stands for “strongly related”. There are no right or wrong ratings. Please just rate the similarity based on your intuition.* 

The whole process took less than 20 minutes, and all the subjects completed the survey without interruption. All the multidimensional scaling data were collected and re-arranged into a 30![](blob:https://di-liu-psychology.netlify.app/f66e27da-3767-43d4-a6aa-0a45370d3404)30 similarity matrix for further analysis. 

**Social Value Orientation slider measure.** When it comes to quantifying people’s social preference, social value orientation has been found to elegantly summarize human’s social-related behaviour across a wide range of interpersonal context. Previous studies have shown that SVO is a reliable and valid measurement of social preferences(Murphy et al., 2011). It provides a continuous construct (∅) measuring how much a decision-maker is willing to sacrifice to make another partner better off (Murphy & Ackermann, 2014).

Students completed the 6-item SVO slider measure after submitting the pairwise similarity rating results. A final SVO value was computed via the standard transformation algorithm for each participant based on their choice in the money allocation SVO task. For the previous sample (Murphy et al., 2011), the test-retest reliability of the current measurement was good (r = 0.599).

**Results**

***Data preprocessing*** 

The correlation between conceptual representation and social value orientation is directly computed via a supportive vector model (SVM). Considering classification nature of the methodology, social value orientation results were reorganized into 4 subtypes before further analysis according to the range given by the developer, including "altruistic", "prosocial", "individualistic", and "competitive"(Murphy et al., 2011).

***Semantic distance judgement task***

The conceptual representation was obtained using a pairwise rating task. Result was rearranged into a 30![](blob:https://di-liu-psychology.netlify.app/f66e27da-3767-43d4-a6aa-0a45370d3404)30 matrix, with each value representing a subjective judgement on the distance between a given concept pair. Multidimensional scaling was carried out to visualize individual semantic distance matrices using the RSA toolbox (Nili et al., 2014) in the MATLAB environment. Moreover, the relationship between each subject was also computed, the current sample showed a median level of correlation (r = 0.35, sd = 0.21). This indicates that there did exist intersubjective difference in word understanding patterns which might contain information about social preferences, and worth more exploration.

Note: In Panel A, the representational semantic distance matrices between individuals were shown. The average correlation coefficient is 0.35, indicating the existence of intersubjective difference in word understanding patterns or conceptual representations. The MDS is shown in Panel B to visualize the distribution of semantic space patterns. 

***Intergroup difference***

The current sample was consisted of 15 prosocial and 4 individualistic individuals, no other subtypes were found probably due to the limited sample size. To investigate whether significant deviations exist in the conceptual representation patterns between these two existing subtypes, an average matrix for each type was produced, and correlation between them was computed. It turned out that the two average matrixes were highly correlated (*r* = 0.88, *p* < 0.001). This can be explained by the fact that individual difference tends to diminish in the averaging process, and partially emphasized the necessary to explore beyond “an average model”.

Note: The visualized average similarity matrix of two subtypes were provided (prosocial-above, individualistic-below). The intergroup correlation achieved 0.88, indicating there was no significant difference between these subtypes, and shedding light on the necessary to look closer at individual level. A cell in the matrix represents the result of the corresponding word pairwise semantic distance rating task, and higher values means higher dissimilarities. 

***SVM model***

Considering the capacity of computational model to capture nuanced and complicated difference in underlying word-understanding patterns and concept representations, here, we aim at exploring whether the social-related semantic similarity matrix can faithfully predict people’s social attitudes via established SVM model. For each training trial, 15 subjects were randomly picked as a training dataset, while the remaining 4 subjects automatically became test dataset. The input values were defined as conceptual representations (semantic rating results), and output values were the label of subtypes according to the range classification. 

30 trails were accomplished to achieve a rather stable depiction of the training effect. Mean accuracy approached 79.30% (SD = 1.92%), and one sample t-test revealed significant difference from the chance level (*t*(29) = 22.23, *p* < 0.001). In general, the training results indicated that SVM can predict nuanced intersubjective difference in social preference via the input of subjects’ word understanding patterns, indicating the potential of conceptual representations in inferring one’s social behaviour preferences. 

**General Discussion**

Do people’s conceptual representation of a same set of social-related vocabularies indicate their preferences under social situations? The results of the pilot study presented here provide certain level of evidence that people’s semantic knowledge did capture some sort of individual traits in decision-making styles under the social situation. Considering the relatively small sample size in the pilot study, further exploration need be made to acquire a more stable conclusion. 

There are more methodologies to adopt when analyzing the correlation between conceptual representations and social value orientation results. SVM approach might lack explicit explanation of the exact mechanism through which word understanding associates with social preferences. Using k-cluster to test whether there are subtle subtypes in the representation data pattern might shed light on the black box in the current SVM. The convergence of findings obtained using multiple approaches can also provide more valid conclusions. It may still be argued that the current correlation does not indicate causation relationship, and further test from the developmental field can provide stronger evidence if enhanced education of conceptual knowledge induces change in social preferences. Moreover, advances can also be made through implementing different paradigm when collecting conceptual representations. Multi-arrangement is an approach that require participants to arrange all of the word stimuli in one run, and can greatly reduce the influence of fatigue in the current design.

Despite the possible indication of relationship between conceptual representations and decision-making styles, the question of origin for individual difference in semantic space has yet been answered. For decades, more researchers have focused on studying the commonly shared mechanism for all, instead of concentrating on each individual. Few attempts of understanding where do intersubjective differences about word understanding come from proposed that it may derive from individual variance in experiencing. People experience different emotions and sensory with the same word. Non-verbal experience formed another form of our stored knowledge, and its correlation with the verbal form requires closer examination in the future.

To conclude, we have emphasized the significance of investigating individuals in the semantic field. Through a pairwise rating task and social value orientation scale, we revealed possible association between conceptual representation of social-related vocabularies and social preferences when making decisions, which need further re-assurance through large sampling recruitment. Such deviations between individuals might induce different performance under social settings, and might explain the underlying difference between social disorder patient and normal group. Increase linguistic knowledge may help people overcome the inconvenience brought by distinguish understanding of the same word, and thus reducing mis-communications, improving efficiency information exchange.
