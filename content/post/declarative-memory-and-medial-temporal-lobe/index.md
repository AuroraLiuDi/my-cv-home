summary: Memory can be classified into a vast number of different types. As one
  of the most important subtypes, declarative memory, distinguished from
  procedural memory, refers to the storage of explicit knowledge about events
  and experiences (Squire, 1987). Before H.M.’s case was thoroughly studied,
  Lashley’s equipotential view, based on the finding that harms in learning and
  memory performance correlated with the size of brain lesions in mice, had been
  famous (Lashley, 1929). Accumulative evidence from amnesia patients has proved
  this holistic view invalid and further led to the localization of memory
  functions, shedding light on the important role played by the medial temporal
  lobe.

Memory can be classified into a vast number of different types. As one of the most important subtypes, declarative memory, distinguished from procedural memory, refers to the storage of explicit knowledge about events and experiences (Squire, 1987). Before H.M.’s case was thoroughly studied, Lashley’s equipotential view, based on the finding that harms in learning and memory performance correlated with the size of brain lesions in mice, had been famous (Lashley, 1929). Accumulative evidence from amnesia patients has proved this holistic view invalid and further led to the localization of memory functions. 

**1. Essential basis for declarative memory: the medial temporal lobe** 

Brain lesion patients have provided valuable insight into the localization of declarative memory storage, shedding light on the vital role played by the medial temporal lobe (MTL). After suffering from lesions in the MTL regions, both human patients (e.g., H.M.) and animal models (e.g., macaque monkeys), have shown symptoms of anterograde amnesia, a severely impaired consolidation of memory (Mishkin & Appenzeller, 1987). Electrical stimulation in the MTL of patients undergoing surgery has also elicited an experience of recalling past experiences (Penfield, 1958), further supporting its potential role in memory formation.

Even after declarative memory has been localized into the specific region of MTL, competing between the hypothesis of whether MTL serves as a whole to support declarative memory (Squire, 2004) or can its substructures be dissociated according to different functions (Baxter & Murray, 2001). Findings tend to favour the existence of functional division within MTL, and have revealed the process through which information flow to form new memory. In a general overview, the higher-order processed information gained in all modalities is projected to the parahippocampal and rhinal cortical areas and is later conveyed to the hippocampus (Dickerson & Eichenbaum, 2010). In the MTL system, the hippocampus has received the most investigation, as it has been suggested to be the major reason MTL lesion patients show symptoms (Zola-Morgan et al., 1986). A review of the hippocampus-related discoveries, especially using the rodents models, concluded that the hippocampus is vital to the encoding of relationships between items, thus critical to the systematically organized memory (Eichenbaum, 1999). 

Not only is MTL essential for memory consolidation, but the symptoms of partial retrograding amnesia shown in brain lesion patients also hinted at its function in temporal memory storage. The hippocampal system has been indicated to sustain memory retrieval by binding together relevant and distributed brain regions representing the memory information as a whole (Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1991). This function is without doubt time-limited, as remote memory before the MTL was harmed remained intact in both H.M.’s case (Corkin, 1984) and monkey models (Zola-Morgan & Squire, 1990). 

Beyond serving the declarative long-term memory, MTL has also been suggested to be responsible for visual working memory (Ranganath & D’Esposito, 2005), and high-order perception of objects, as well as scenarios (Buckley, 2005). The double dissociation of performance between Alzheimer’s disease patients, suffering hippocampus damage, and semantic dementia patients, suffering the loss of perirhinal cortex volume, in oddity judgment task using faces and scenes as materials, which does not involve declarative memory (Lee et al., 2006), the same effect was replicated using another set of stimuli (Lee et al., 2007). Relevant discoveries have also found that perirhinal lesion induced worsened performance in the discrimination of high-ambiguity objects, while selective hippocampal damage showed no effect in the same discrimination tasks (Barense et al., 2005). These results have suggested that MTL might be involved with functions beyond supporting the memory system. 

**2. Neural mechanism underlying different subtypes of declarative memory**

Initially, based on the materials used for memory tasks, declarative memory can be further divided into two branches, including semantic memory of verbal facts, and episodic memory about events (Tulving, 1972), and the distinction in between has been supported by clinical findings (Nielsen, 1958). A more refined view (Tulving & Markowitsch, 1998)was established with precise localization of lesions using MRI in amnesia patients, suggesting that semantic memory largely depends on the perihippocampal cortical regions, while episodic memory relies on the hippocampus (Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997). 

The logic underlying the difference between semantic memory and episodic memory can be extended to form a coordinate consisting of two continuous indexes, including time-specificity and personal relevance. Prior research using a better-graded set of stimuli further revealed that the left hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and left temporal pole are activated in retrieving personal related and time-specific memories, which is in-between the semantic and the episodic (Maguire & Mummery, 1999). 

**3. Other interesting research directions**

Apart from identifying the individual functions and networks underlying declarative memory, the focus on how memory consolidation can be modulated by other factors has also attracted attention. Prior efforts in understanding the potential modulators have identified a clear age-relevant shift in the neural system underlying long-term declarative memory (Donix et al., 2010). Sleep has been another interesting factor considered to influence the network level change in memory consolidation (Tononi & Cirelli, 2014), and not affect the mechanism underlying retrieval (Cousins & Fernández, 2019).
