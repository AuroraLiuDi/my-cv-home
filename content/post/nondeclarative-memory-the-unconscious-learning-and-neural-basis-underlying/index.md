Memory is not a single unity, but a collection of various components. Nondeclarative memory has been defined as a set of unconscious memory abilities that are not declarative. It has been empirically shown that amnesia patients, who have memory loss of facts and events, preserve the ability to perform pattern-based mirror reading via training, and can retain the learned skill for 3 months without explicit memory (Cohen & Squire, 1980). Another paradigm, requiring the participants to learn implicitly about the spelling of words, also found this procedure memory intact in the amnesia group(Graf et al., 1984). These findings seem to support a dissociation between memory and awareness, suggesting the faculty of memory can be further divided into an unconscious and implicit nondeclarative part, in contrast to the conscious and explicit declarative component (Squire, 1992). From another perspective, another prior literature has also interpreted such dissociation as a difference in retrieval level, distinguished from recalling and recognition (Jacoby & Witherspoon, 1982).

Brain lesion studies, as well as newly emerged neuroimaging techniques, have revealed valid separate anatomy structures underlying this dichotomy. Patients with injuries to the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortices (i.e., entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal region) show severe anterograde amnesia while remaining intact in the implicit learning abilities (Squire, 1992), suggesting the nondeclarative memory do not rely on these areas. Even though the involvement of MTL is used as a critical distinction between declarative and nondeclarative memory, it is yet not so clear what is the exact relationship between hippocampal activation and consciousness (Hannula & Greene, 2012), which might need further exploration in the future. 

Though the distinction between declarative and nondeclarative memory is well-studied, the subdivision of nondeclarative field remains rather ambiguous. Such vagueness is determined by the nature of this collection mentioned above, as it is defined to be a collection of various systems that do not belong to the biologically meaningful structure of declarative memory (Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1988; Squire, 1992). The current subdivision of nondeclarative memory heavily relies on the content of tasks used for testing, resulting in a less systematic taxonomy. A rough depiction of nondeclarative memory subtypes includes procedural information (i.e., mirror drawing), priming (i.e., pictural priming), simple classical conditioning (contains emotional responses, and skeletal musculature), and non-associative learning (i.e., habituation). One downside of this organization is that it failed to conclude all paradigms used in testing implicit memory, such as probabilistic categorization learning, artificial grammar learning, and category acquisition. A potential improvement I suggest is shown in the figure below.

Similarly, there is no single and coherent neural system, as MTL in the declarative memory, that serves all the nondeclarative abilities. The acquisition of nondeclarative memory is proposed to reflect accumulated changes in the circuits activated when the initial learning process occurs (Reber, 2013). Examples of these local circuits include basal ganglia, which contains the striatum and neocortex, which have been proposed as one of the regions underlying implicit memory (McClelland et al., 1995; Eichenbaum & Cohen, 2004). Patients with Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease with lesions in the caudate nucleus, on the other hand, have deficits in tasks involving domain-specific nondeclarative memory in the probabilistic classification learning task (Knowlton, Mangels, et al., 1996), highlighting the relevant area as one potential basis of nondeclarative memory. Huntington patients, however, show normal functioning in the artificial grammar learning tasks, suggesting neocortex, rather than the neostriatum, might account for this pattern learning task (Knowlton, Squire, et al., 1996). The lack of integration and the involvement of hippocampal regions might lead to a less flexible feature in nondeclarative knowledge (Eichenbaum & Cohen, 2004), which is consistent with previous behavioural discovery extending distinctions between declarative and nondeclarative memory from the level of consciousness to flexibility, with declarative memory closely related to different cognitions and the nondeclarative being more restricted to the initial systems involved in learning (Squire & Zola, 1996).

From the subdivisions mentioned up front, categorization skill is really intriguing, as it is intuitively related to verbal knowledge of the declarative field. Investigation using more complicated stimuli compared with the dot pattern paradigm adopted in earlier work further confirms that amnesia patients do show same competency in the category acquisition task as the control, despite having no explicit memory of the features they observed in the training (Reed et al., 1999). Potential interpretation is such categorization only requires perceptual learning, which can be completed in the spared early visual processing areas (Reber & Squire, 1999). Neuroimaging evidence gained from healthy participants has discovered that the declarative and nondeclarative memory systems interact in the classification task. Rapid modulation in MTL activation is found in the beginning of learning, which declines with training, suggesting a shift from declarative memory to associative learning (Poldrack et al., 2001). Categorization in daily life involves information integration that is not verbalizable, and nondeclarative memory system is responsible for the storage of such categories (Ashby & Crossley, 2010).

In conclusion, nondeclarative memory carries information that is implicit and not being processed by MTL. Without any hub-like structure in the neural system to integrate nondeclarative memory, this processing simply occurs in the local regions that is activated by raw sensory information. The economical information stored in nondeclarative memory is responsible for not only the unverbalizable knowledge but also for inducing more effective response that is vital for survival.
