  - title: "Topic 1: What is the nature of individual differences in semantic knowledge representation"
    company: "RA at Yanchao Bi's Concept Lab (BNU) & Affective Science and Culture Lab (Yale)"
    company_url: ''
    location: 'Beijing & New Haven (remote)'
    date_start: '2020-03-20'
    date_end: '2023-06-30'
    description: |2-
        To be more specific:
        
        * Core question: Are individual differences in semantic knowledge purely noise or meaningful reflection of traits in other cognitive processing?
        * Measurement: Word-pair similarity rating, Multi-arrangement task, Natural language processing based on large corpus
        * Analysis: Support vector machine, Relevant vector machine, Representational similarity analysis, Clustering (k-means & hierarchical)
        * Responsibility: Conduct literature review, Collect and analyze data, Contribut to academic publications
        * Preliminary results: Organization of conceptual knowlegde in emotions can predict emotional perception & mental fitness


      
  - title: "Topic 2: Individual difference in interpreting semantic meanings from perceptual stimmuli"
    company: "RA to Perception & Semantic research Group"
    company_url:  ''
    location: 'Princeton & Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics'
    date_start: '2022-07-10'
    date_end: '2023-01-31'
    description: |2-
        To be more specific:
        
        * Project aim: Identify people's prototype of semantic categories
        * Follow up question 1: Which semantic category (concept) has the most ambiguous preceptual prototype? 
        * Follow up question 2: Which visual stimuli elicit highest inter-subject variation in semantic interpretation?
        * Measurement: Developing different sampling logorithms to approach the prototype
        * Responsibilities: Implement paradigms online, Preliminary data analysis, Report writing

       
  - title: "Topic 3: How do differences in semantic knowledge come into being"
    company: "RA to Language and Cognition Lab (Stanford) & ReadOxford Research Group (Oxford)"
    company_url:  ''
    location: 'Stanford & University of Oxford'
    date_start: '2021-09-30'
    date_end: '2023-01-31'
    description: |2-
        To be more specific:
       
        * Research line 1: Do language and cultural background influence relational reasoning styles? (a general cognitive ability influencing encoding)
        * Research line 2: Do individuals acquire valence information from reading materials? (a verbal ability influencing semantic knowledge acquisition) 
        * Indirectly answer the question: What influences our acquisition of semantic knowledge? 
        * Measurement: run experiement on 3- to 12-year-old kids
        * Responsibilities: Develop experimental materials, Experimenter, Preliminary data analysis
