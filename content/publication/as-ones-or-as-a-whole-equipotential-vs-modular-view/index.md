  How does the human mind work? The debate between viewing the brain as a
  collection of independent systems and as a unity in functioning has always
  existed. With the development of techniques, the conflict between theories
  gradually got mediated. The modern view of brain functioning concludes that
  cognitive processes are carried out by different areas, consistent with the
  modular theory; and areas are activated in an organized network way to perform
  behaviours, similar to the equipotential assumption. This article reviews and
  analyses how the opposing arguments interact with the

  evolutions of theories and methodologies in neuroscience history.

What is the relationship between brain structure and behaviours? One classical theory proposes that brain regions work independently as modular (Fodor, 1983). An alternative equipotential view, evidenced by neural plasticity (Keidel et al., 2010), assumes that each brain area involves equally in all potential functions (Lashley, 1929). Debates between these seemingly mutual-exclusive theories have interacted with promotions in neurological theories (i.e., neural networks) and technologies (i.e., computational models). 

**1. Origins of theories revealing logic behind**

The prevalent trend of viewing the brain as a collection of different modules can be attributed to a common problem-solving strategy, which is, that the most efficient way of analyzing a complex system is to break it down into units (Coltheart, 1999; Marr, 2010). Following this logic, phrenology has argued that brain areas, reflected by the size of the skull, are responsible for various personality traits, which is the origin of localization theory (Gall, 1825). In the same period, the discovery of motor and sensory fibres further confirmed the same electric signal is interpreted differently by distinct physiological structures (Grzybowski & Kaufman, 2007; Kandel et al., 2000; Waller, 1911), evidencing the base of modular theory indirectly.

Alternatively, the equipotential theory is consistent with the physiological idea that the brain, or “mind”, works as a homogeneous system that becomes meaningless if isolated into parts. Original empirical evidence was provided by Flourens. He concluded, from his discovery that brain functions gradually disappear proportionally to the size of ablation by destroying different parts of animals’ brains (including pigeons and frogs), that “the cerebral cortex functioned as an indivisible whole” (Bear et al., 2020; Changeux, 1997; Flourens, 1842). 

Assumptions of both sides were initially restricted by limitations in experimental technique. Phrenology is based completely on a correlational study, which is unreliable for deducing a causal relationship between the size of the area and personality. Experimental ablation methodology was first developed to systematically test Gall’s assertations (Pearce, 2009). Interestingly, distinctions between theories lead to advances in research methods, and new technology further promotes theories to review their statements, shaping neuroscience history. Moreover, though limited by methodology, one essential consensus was still achieved, which is, the brain serves as the only organ of the mind. 

**2 Accumulating evidence and shaping of research**

Brought by new understanding and technology of neuro-anatomy, more experimental evidence accumulated on both sides. The purpose of this section is to summarize key facts in the historical timeline, reveal their projection of technology development, and analyze how they influence broad neuroscience research interest. 

**2.1 Modular view and its extension.**

***2.1.1 Summary of important historical findings.***

To rebut the statement that the brain works as a whole, the most efficient way is to find a brain-lesion patient who only shows defects in *one* specific cognitive domain. Broca’s famous case study (using 12 patients, including “Tan”) has revealed the causal link between a lesion in the left posterior of the frontal lobe and disability in speech production (Pearce, 2003). A piece of parallel evidence provided by Wernicke identified another region where injuries induce loss of speech comprehension (Lanczik & Keil, 1991; C Wernicke, 1874). Discoveries of different language-related regions inspired Wernicke to further develop an idea of distributed processing, mapping how language, an elegant aggregation of various cognitive processes, is carried out by a set of separate modules (Gage & Hickok, 2005). 

The other line of empirical studies involved direct stimulation of the target brain areas. By electrically stimulating the precentral gyrus, Fritsch and Hitzig were able to produce limb actions in dogs (Breathnach, 1992; Fritsch & Hitzig, 2009; Kandel et al., 2000). Human-based study during surgery confirmed, that if the regions related to language were interfered with by electrodes, the patients could not name objects (Ojemann, 1983). 

In addition, another figure in the modular theory is Brodmann, who separated the cortex into 52 areas based on the shapes of cells (Brodmann, 1909; Loukas et al., 2011). This cytoarchitectonic method was proved valid by experimental mapping results (Adrian, 1939; Marshall et al., 1937).

***2.1.2 Classic methodology and modern development.***

To localize functions, developing a causal link in between and ruling out confounds is of great significance, thus calling for systematical methodologies. The facts mentioned above featured two basic and widely performed empirical methods in neuroscience, including analyzing behavioural distinction between brain-lesion patients and the control, and experimental design, where an operation is conducted, and the consequences are observed (i.e., human cortical stimulation).

One major change in methods across time is that human participants are given greater value, as the risk of generalizing findings based on animal models to humans has been emphasized. Intrusive techniques, such as experimental ablation and surgery, are restricted for ethical concerns. Thanks to neuroimaging techniques (i.e., fMRI and PET), the thrive of non-intrusive methodology carried out on healthy participants at a fine scale is accessible (Bertolero et al., 2015; Mumford et al., 2010; Op de Beeck et al., 2008). The temporal information allows for the deduction of a causal link between a cognitive task and an activated brain area. 

Except expanding the accessible participants, advanced technology has also pushed the modular theory to update. For example, TMS offers not only a great substitute for intrusive cortical stimulation, but also supports a more flexible functional-network assumption, as remote interconnected brain regions are all affected when applying TMS (Ruff et al., 2009). 

***2.1.3 Theoretical development and shaping of neuroscience research interest.***

While defending itself from the equipotential view, efforts in localizing functional modules also shed light on one predominant research purpose in the neuroscience area, which is, to prove that the brain (or “mind”) is an aggregation of separate elementary functions. An apparent distinction between the contemporary localization view and phrenology is that the complex behavioural patterns (i.e., personality) are no longer assumed to be localized (Tizard, 1959). The basic cognitive modules, on the other hand, are assumed to be processed by functionally independent regions, and add up together to perform higher-order functions, including emotions, perceptions, and thoughts (James et al., 1890). 

The modular theory has shaped the broad interest of neuroscience research interest with the logic of “break-down”. One line of research tends to focus on studying basic cognitive functions, such as vision and hearing. Questions of interest include how each modular process submodules of a certain information modality (i.e., color and shape in visual information). The other set of studies emphasizes breaking down complex behaviours into components (i.e., reading, hearing, organizing, and motoring in language). 

**2.2 Equipotential view and its extension.**

***2.2.1 Summary of important historical findings.***

Due to crude anatomy technology, scattered evidence was found in support of the equipotential view. The influential Gestalt psychology has also attacked the modular view for separating the mind into meaningless pieces, influencing the wholistic theory (Köhler, 1967). 

However, the holistic side has not been truly developed until Lashely’s results were published. Measuring the performance of rates with different amounts of impairment in the cortex in running the maze, he observed a correlation between intelligence and the size of the lesion (Lashley, 1929). The dominant distinction between Lashley and Flourens is the former confined the application of equipotentiality to the more complicated functions. However, alternative interpretations of Lashley’s results exist, as the maze running task requires multiple modalities of sensation, and even if one is destroyed, the others can still compensate (Hunter, 1930; Pavlov, 1941). 

Contemporary findings of plasticity support equipotential theory to some extent, weakening the proposal of modularity as well (Buller & Hardcastle, 2000). Animals have shown great potential in reconstructing representations facing neural degradation (Bao et al., 2003). The human cortex has shown similar traits when being trained to perform a new motor task (Draganski et al., 2004), recognize novel objects (Gauthier et al., 1999), and discriminate pitch (Bosnyak et al., 2004). These shreds of evidence suggest that neurons from different brain regions can also adapt to functions of other areas, inconsistent with the rigid localization view. 

***2.2.2 Classic methodology and modern development.***

Though not able to rule out confounds, Lashley’s work has still been valuable to the methodology field. His attempt to objectively measure behaviours is essential for systematically observing the difference between experimental and control groups. Quantization of task performance also allows for statistical analysis. Animal models in the neuroscience field are now much more convincing. 

Modern mathematical techniques, such as computational models, has revealed a new possibility of simulating brain activity as a whole by modeling the connection between brain regions (Keidel et al., 2010). 

***2.2.3 Theoretical development and shaping of neuroscience research interest.***

One giant leap made by equipotential theory is its shift from viewing all functions as being holistic to emphasizing only the high-order ones. This position has been vital in the development of brain network theory for the logic of “the whole is greater than the sum of parts” (Köhler, 1967). It has inspired the field to examine functions that can only be performed as a connected “one” (i.e., plasticity, and prognosis of brain lesion). 

**3. Modern views of brain-behaviour relationship**

Combined together, modular and equipotential theories have been merged to establish a refined view of brain-behaviour connection, where connections and divisions are both valued. A general shift in both views is that instead of sticking to the rigid localization of modules or holistic opinion, current researchers favour a dynamic and interactive network (Rahimpour et al., 2019).

Contemporary network theory originates from Wernicke’s reconciliation of two classical views. His statement that cognitive functions are carried out by different components introduced the tenet of “distributed processing” (Fox & Friston, 2012; Rumelhart et al., 1988; Simon et al., 2006). The model connecting Broca’s area, association area, and Wernicke’s area together as a network has been powerful in explaining aphasia (Carl Wernicke, 1874). Adoptions of functional neuroimaging techniques (Mumford et al., 2010) and math models (Happel & Murre, 1994) have provided more empirical and vivid support for the interconnected network view. 

In general, mutually exclusive opinions were grounded on opposing observations, which were initially restricted by rudimentary methods. By attacking each other and finding new evidence to support themselves, they eventually got the neuroscience field to take both the individual function of brain regions and their connections into consideration, and arrive at a more precise descriptive theory about how the brain functions.
