Humans tend to represent emotional knowledge in an idiosyncratic manner. Potential individual differences in understanding emotional labels may derive from how we organize information about them in our mental space. The dimensional structure of this emotional semantic space is characterized either by discrete categories (i.e., happy and sad), or affective loadings (i.e., valence and arousal). Here, using pairwise similarity ratings across categories and distance matrix computed based on valence and arousal ratings, we revealed that both theoretical spaces reflect robust individual differences in emotional knowledge. A low correlation between the two spaces suggested that they potentially capture different aspects of knowledge representations. We also applied hierarchical clustering to identify subtypes of the structural patterns in two spaces. Even though they are both divided into two subtypes, we found the specific clustering results inconsistent, illustrating the different nature of the two space structures. Moreover, the amount of verbal knowledge has been suggested to have a positive effect on emotional well-being, we further explored whether thestructure of corresponding knowledge is the mechanism underlying that link. Using a relevant vector regression (RVR) model, we discovered that in both structural forms, part of the emotional semantic space, depicting how an individual understands non-positive items, is correlated with one’s propensity for anxiety and depression. Two semantic spaces also dissociate with each other in predicting different mood disorder symptoms. Our findings provided insights into future clinical interventions by emphasizing that semantic knowledge representation plays a role in mental health, and that patients with different mood disorders may organize their emotional knowledge primarily according to different forms of semantic space structures.
