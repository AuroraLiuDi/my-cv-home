The meaningful individual variance of emotional knowledge originates from the corresponding organization structure. Previous theories have proposed that dimensions of emotional semantic space are either 18 distinct categories, or affective loadings (i.e., valence and arousal). Here, using pairwise similarity rating results and distance matrices of valence- and arousal ratings, we aimed to reveal the individual difference in emotional semantic space computed based on both theories, and investigate their relationship. Further hierarchical clustering revealed two subtypes within each form of semantic space. The low consistency coefficient of clustering results suggested potential dissociation between the two forms. By testing the prediction of emotional semantic space, especially the section depicting how people understand non-positive emotions, about anxiety and depression symptoms, our results have also shed light on possible influences that emotional knowledge structure might have on emotional well-being. Comparison between two forms of semantic space in predicting mood problems yielded different associations with anxiety and depression and therefore may provide insights into further clinical studies.
