I am Di Liu, a senior studying **psychology** at Beijing Normal University, and am currently studying at Lady Magaret Hall, University of Oxford as a visiting student. My research  interests broadly falls upon cognitive, social and developmental psychology. I have worked extensively on studying **semantic knowledge** (i.e., how people understand word meanings) on the level of individuals. I am particularly curious about how these difference in language comprehension come into being, and what it the nature of such variations (i.e., purely noise in the measurement or reflection of cognitive differences). Based on my research line, I plan to investigate how individuals interact with each other to overcome ambiguities in verbal communication when pursuing doctoral education in the future.
