title: "Emotional Semantic Space: Individual Difference and Prediction of
  Emotional Well-being"
abstract: Humans tend to represent emotional knowledge in an idiosyncratic
  manner. Potential individual differences in understanding emotional labels may
  derive from how we organize information about them in our mental space. The
  dimensional structure of this emotional semantic space is characterized either
  by discrete categories (i.e., happy and sad), or affective loadings (i.e.,
  valence and arousal). Here, using pairwise similarity ratings across
  categories and distance matrix computed based on valence and arousal ratings,
  we revealed that both theoretical spaces reflect robust individual differences
  in emotional knowledge. A low correlation between the two spaces suggested
  that they potentially capture different aspects of knowledge representations.
  We also applied hierarchical clustering to identify subtypes of the structural
  patterns in two spaces. Even though they are both divided into two subtypes,
  we found the specific clustering results inconsistent, illustrating the
  different nature of the two space structures. Moreover, the amount of verbal
  knowledge has been suggested to have a positive effect on emotional
  well-being, we further explored whether the structure of corresponding
  knowledge is the mechanism underlying that link. Using a relevant vector
  regression (RVR) model, we discovered that in both structural forms, part of
  the emotional semantic space, depicting how an individual understands
  non-positive items, is correlated with oneâ€™s propensity for anxiety and
  depression. Two semantic spaces also dissociate with each other in predicting
  different mood disorder symptoms. Our findings provided insights into future
  clinical interventions by emphasizing that semantic knowledge representation
  plays a role in mental health, and that patients with different mood disorders
  may organize their emotional knowledge primarily according to different forms
  of semantic space structures.
